E-learning snap based server for special teaching purposes

NOTE: This is a learning project, mainly in alpha state,
a lot of code cleaning is necessary.

Configuration
-------------

The file format for configuration is YAML.

Documentation
-------------

All the documentation can be found in the `doc` directory, although it is not
well-developed at the moment. We have just stepped into the phase of the
project where real documentation is started to be crucial.
